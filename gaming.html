 <h1>What</h1>
 <div><p>
  One of my good friends would readily remind me of how much I am not a gamer.
  It's true, I'm not. I don't play very often and I'm not particularly good at
  them. Nonetheless, I do enjoy them when I find the time.
 </p><p>
  I collect consoles, primarily handhelds. Might post a collector's list
  someday.. However I don't really collect the games for them, and definitely
  not alternate editions.
 </p><p>
  I'm also into TCGs, though I have no one to play with anymore! Pok&#233;mon is
  my favorite, but I have also somewhat seriously played YuGiOh. You can see my
  deck case <a target="_blank" href="http://oi41.tinypic.com/idt8yd.jpg">here</a>. (Those
  are pogs and counter stones, not dildos.)
 </p><p>
  Other than that, I play computer games a bit. Primarily flash games as
  evidenced by my level on Kongregate, and MMORPGs. Mabinogi being the main
  one but I try others from time to time. My friend is trying to reinterest
  me in Vindictus, and sometimes I play Dragon Nest. I would really like to
  play Wakfu again but it's basicaly P2P now so I'll have to wait a while. I
  used to play WoW pretty hardcore and I intend to reinstall it to use a free
  account for addon development, but I won't be paying for it again.
