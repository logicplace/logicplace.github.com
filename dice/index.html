<h1>Introduction <a here="introduction"></a></h1>
<p>The use of this module can be as complex as you want it to be. Simple use is akin to all 
dice rollers I've seen, and based on standard notation for those who do this sort of thing 
written. That is, of course, <icode>1d6</icode> being &quot;roll one six-sided die&quot;. It 
may look something like this:</p>
<code>dice 1d6
Set 1: [ 4 ] = 4</code>
<p>Where complex use can be something like:</p>
<code>dice --p 5,<g s>Will Save: </g> + <g>1d10-z<g b>1</g> >> 0?<g s>Successful (by %)</g> % s:<g s>Failed</g></g>
Set 1: [ 6 ] = 6
Will Save: Successful (by 1)</code>
<p>You may also use <icode>d</icode> instead of <icode>dice</icode> for the command.</p>
<h1>Understanding Output <a here="understanding_output"></a></h1>
<p>I tried to make the output as easily understandable as possible, but nonetheless here is 
a quick explanation.</p>
<p>Large integers are expressed in <icode>#e+#</icode> notation, entire output string is truncated 
to 100 characters.</p>
<p>First it outputs all of the dice rolls that were made with its set number. If the roll was 
in a <a href="st.html#if">conditional</a>, it will not report that set if it wasn't rolled (this 
does not affect numbering).</p>
<p>Its display is in the form <icode>Set #: [ Rolls ] = Total</icode></p>
<p>If used from an <a href="st.html#each">each statement</a>, form is: <icode>Set #: Totals</icode></p>
<p>The set number is just a number, starting at 1.</p>
<p>Rolls is a comma separated list of the rolls made and any calculations performed on them 
individually. <em>If a roll value's representation is exactly the same as the previous, it will 
output a period instead.</em> This is probably the most confusing part of the output, so remember 
it.</p>
<p>Total is simply all the rolls added together, in sequence.</p>
<p>Afterwards is the expression output. Multiple expressions are separated by commas on input. 
This output is one expression per line. By default, it output the calculation and its result 
separated by an equals sign. If the expression and the result look the same, it does not 
output anything for this expression, assuming the output is already obvious. There are 
<a href="cli.html">command line options</a> to change the output.</p>
