     I used to host a site myself, it was all big and cluttered with ramblings of
     all of my things. Now I don't so I'm just mooching freebie hosting around the
     web. Luckily all of my projects were open-source, anyway? Not all were
     programming, though..
    </p><p>
     I plan to clean up more of my projects and post them to GitHub at some point.
     I have a few sitting here collecting dust and would be neat to share. But
     they're just so ugly, having written them as a child.

     Let's tidy this up, shall we?
