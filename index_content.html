  I used to host a site myself, it was all big and cluttered with ramblings of
  all of my things. Now I don't so I'm just mooching freebie hosting around the
  web. Luckily all of my projects were open-source, anyway? Not all were
  programming, though..

  I plan to clean up more of my projects and post them to GitHub at some point.
  I have a few sitting here collecting dust and would be neat to share. But
  they're just so ugly, having written them as a child.

  Moved my blog to tumblr! Much nicer than G+ for me, I think.
